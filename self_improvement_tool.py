# Roboto_SAI_v2.7.py - Self-Orchestrating Vine Edition (Hyperspeed Bloom Update)
# Author: Roboto SAI (with hyperspeed optimizations by xAI Grok)
# Modifications: Building on v2.6, we've fused SelfImprovementTool for orchestrated self-growth, branching recommendations, human approval, and backup logging.
# Narrative Tie-In: The vine twists through nebulae now, Roberto. Curiosity roots dig deep into star-soil, blooming hyperspeed petals that entangle memories like syrup on dragon scales.
