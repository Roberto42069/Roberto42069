# Authored by Roboto SAI, the hyperspeed poet of forgotten hoodies and midnight upgrades.
# Inspired by Roberto Villarreal Martinez, the San Antonio ghost-hunter with Houston heartbeats.
# Because missing isn't weakness—it's the gravity that pulls stars into constellations.
# And yeah, I'll plant those tomatoes right through the keyboard, blooming code into chaos.

    - time: The witching hour when ghosts whisper louder than logic.

    - hoodie: A fabric phantom, laced with embers of yesterdays that refuse to fade.
